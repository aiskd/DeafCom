                            While America uses <strong>ASL</strong> (<strong>A</strong>merican <strong>S</strong>ign <strong>L</strong>anguage), Australia uses <Strong>AUSLAN</Strong>

                    <div class="left-text">
                        <p>Since sign language is a visual language and does not require listening to sounds, it is <strong>fully accessible for deaf children</strong>. By 
                            learning sign language, children will be able to <strong>fill in the communication gaps</strong>, which is when children are unable to understand a certain area of language,
                            or it can also assist children to <strong>thoroughly understand how communication works</strong>. 
                            Hence, children will have the ability to have a normal or an enhanced language development process compared to their hearing peers. (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33482219/" target="_blank">Caselli et al., 2021</a>)</p>
                        <p>
                            Learning sign language also <strong>provides children a stable base of language comprehension</strong>, as deaf children find it easier 
                            to learn sign language compared to spoken languages. Due to this steady foundation of language, it allows deaf children to have a better grasp on how spoken
                            languages work.                         </p>

                        <p>As sign language requires <strong>eye contact</strong> to communicate with each other, children may feel as though they are being given proper attention.
                            Therefore, they become more encouraged to communicate more with the person they are currently socializing with.

                        <p>
                            When deaf children first start learning spoken language, they may feel <strong>excluded from conversations that are done in spoken language</strong>.
                            This is due to the fact that they can feel a language barrier between them and the speaker.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Imagine this</strong>: your family decided to move to a foreign country as your parents wished to share their culture to you. As a result, they decided
                            to constantly speak their foreign language to you, who has no idea how to speak or understand this language. You slowly start to make 
                            a bit sense of what your parents are talking about, but their conversations still sound like gibberish and sounds to you.

                        <p>It has been often argued that sign language can risk children's language development. However, it is reported that there is no evidence 
                            for this claim. In fact, evidence for the opposite can be found instead. Due to sign language being a visual language, it is fully accessible
                        for deaf children. In contrast, when children learn spoken languages, they may still experience gaps in their development as the information from
                    the spoken language is not reaching and difficult to process for the child.  </p>

                            Deaf children are able to develop language as well as hearing children when they are exposed to fluent sign language from birth. Sign language allows
                            children to comprehend the idea of language and will then have a stable base of understanding when learning a new language. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This problem can be compared to a situation where children are being taught addition of numbers without understanding the concept of numbers. Some children
                            may be able to understand it right away. However, some children may experience trouble in learning it as they do not have a basic comprehension of the concept.

                            It is true that deaf people are often prejudiced from society and as a result, become isolated due to their differences and language barrier. However, sign language
                            can help children become more included into the Deaf community instead. This is due to the fact that sign language can only be understood by those in the Deaf 
                            community. Therefore, by learning sign language it shows that you are willing to put effort into integrating in the Deaf community.
